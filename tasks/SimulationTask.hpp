    /*! \class SimulationTask
     * \brief The task context provides and requires services. It uses an ExecutionEngine
     to perform its functions.
     * Essential interfaces are operations, data flow ports and properties. These
     interfaces have been defined using the oroGen specification.
     * In order to modify the interfaces you should (re)use oroGen and rely on the
     associated workflow.
     *
     * \details
     * The name of a TaskContext is primarily defined via:
     \verbatim
     deployment 'deployment_name'
         task('custom_task_name','motors_weg_cvw300::SimulationTask')
     end
     \endverbatim
     *  It can be dynamically adapted when the deployment is called with a prefix
     argument.
